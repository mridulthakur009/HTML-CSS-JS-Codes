All the trainers were helpful and supportive. They used to give us enough time from their busy schedule as well. There were certain things that can be taken into account like some of the trainers were not able to come up to the level of a trainee although they must be good developers. Although they had prepared a Structure Training programme but weren't able to implement that properly. The one more major thing that was faced during training was that there were topics that were covered but some of the trainees were not able to understand it properly and on the next day next topic was being taught. Due to this many backlogs arise. And one more thing I want to highlight is that feedback should be given at certain intervals so that if there any area of improvement then one should be able to work on it immediately.
